# Basic Machine Learning Project: Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to testing and learning the basics of machine learning (ML). The primary focus is on understanding and implementing fundamental ML models and preprocessing techniques. The project revolves around predicting the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties. This practical approach helps in grasping the core concepts of ML and data science.

## Dataset

The project uses two datasets:

- Red Wine Quality Dataset
- White Wine Quality Dataset
  These datasets are available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contain information about various properties of wines, such as acidity, sugar level, alcohol content, etc., along with a quality rating.

## Objectives

- To explore and preprocess the wine quality datasets.
- To understand and implement different machine learning models.
- To compare the performance of various models and learn the importance of hyperparameter tuning.
- To gain insights into handling real-world data and the challenges involved, like dealing with imbalanced data.

## Models Explored

1. Decision Trees
2. Random Forests

## Repository Structure
